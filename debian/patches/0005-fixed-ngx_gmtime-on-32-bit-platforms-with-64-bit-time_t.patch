Subject: Fixed ngx_gmtime() on 32-bit platforms with 64-bit time_t.

In ngx_gmtime(), instead of casting to ngx_uint_t we now work with
time_t directly.  This allows using dates after 2038 on 32-bit platforms
which use 64-bit time_t, notably NetBSD and OpenBSD.

As the code is not able to work with negative time_t values, argument
is now set to 0 for negative values.  As a positive side effect, this
results in Epoch being used for such values instead of a date in distant
future.
